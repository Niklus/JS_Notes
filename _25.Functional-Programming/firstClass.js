4. First class functions

In JavaScript, functions are first-class entities. 
Functions are treated just like data in functional programming
The ability to treat functions as values letâ€™s us use them in the following ways:
	
	1. Refer to it from constants and variables
	2. Pass it as a parameter to other functions
	3. Return it as result from other functions

Functions are the core unit of abstraction in functional programming
